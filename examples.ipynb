    "2.) I want to call attention to my use of radius if the 'if' part of the if/else block in Sphere.  You see \\_\\_super\\_\\_().\\_\\_init\\_\\_ will set self.radius to radius, so there is no need to do it earlier.  If you called Sphere.\\_\\_init\\_\\_ with a volume parameter and no radius, radius would start set to False, then it would reset that variable based on a calculation from volume, then because \\_\\_super\\_\\_().\\_\\_init\\_\\_ simply is setting its kwarg (keyword argument) to the value of the radius variable, it is recieving the changed value rather than the default of False.  If you followed up until now and I lost you here, thats fine.  Its a miracle I was able to guide you this far.  I fuckin barely understand this crap."
